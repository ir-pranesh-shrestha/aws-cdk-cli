// bootstrapping also performs synthesis. As it turns out, bootstrap-stage synthesis still causes the lookups to be cached, meaning that the lookup never
// happens when we actually call `cdk synth --no-lookups`. This results in the error never being thrown, because it never tries to lookup anything.
// Fix this by not trying to bootstrap; there's no need to bootstrap anyway, since the test never tries to deploy anything.
