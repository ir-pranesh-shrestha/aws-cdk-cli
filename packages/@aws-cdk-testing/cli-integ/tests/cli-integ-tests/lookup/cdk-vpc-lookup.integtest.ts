// autoDeleteObjects prop set to true, which creates a Lambda backed
// CustomResource. Since the compiled Lambda code (e.g. __entrypoint__.js)
// is bundled as part of the CDK package, we want to make sure we don't
// introduce changes to the compiled code that could prevent the Lambda from
// executing. If we do, this test will timeout and fail.
