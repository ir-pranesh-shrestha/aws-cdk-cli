# AWS Cloud Development Kit (AWS CDK) Toolkit

[![NPM version](https://badge.fury.io/js/aws-cdk.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/aws-cdk)

The **AWS Cloud Development Kit (AWS CDK)** is an open-source software
development framework to define cloud infrastructure in code and provision it
through AWS CloudFormation.

The AWS CDK consists of two main components:

- a [class library](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk), that you use to
  to model your infrastructure in code; and
- a *toolkit*, consisting of a CLI or a programmatic library, to act on those
  models.

This repository contains the code for the toolkit components. The [class library
repository](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk) is the main repository for the CDK
project.

## Getting Help

The best way to interact with our team is through GitHub, on the [aws-cdk
repository](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk). You can open an
[issue](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk/issues/new/choose) and choose from one of
our templates for bug reports, feature requests, documentation issues, or
guidance.

If you have a support plan with AWS Support, you can also create a new [support case](https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home#/).

You may also find help on these community resources:

* Look through the [API Reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/latest/docs/aws-construct-library.html) or [Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide)
* The #aws-cdk Slack channel in [cdk.dev](https://cdk.dev)
* Ask a question on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/aws-cdk)
  and tag it with `aws-cdk`

## Compatibility

The CLI is always able to process CDK apps using a version of the Construct Library
released before it. We recommend you always keep the CLI version up-to-date to get the
latest features.

For more details on the compatibility model and specific versions that work together,
see [COMPATIBILITY.md](COMPATIBILITY.md).
